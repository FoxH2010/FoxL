## Description  
This programming language (FoxL) was created, expect to be a high-level prgramming language desktop application developing language that's ease to use for web-developer. Might release the next year.  
FoxL is for application developing, rather than web. But I hopes you'll find it suit yourself.
### Disclaimer  
This project have been transfered from Sharp Fox to FoxH. We still include Sharp Fox's name in the License, but it'll be gone soon enough.  
### Version  
The current latest version of FoxL is FoxL v0.0.3. FoxL v0.0.4 is currently developing under the [dev branch](https://github.com/FoxH2010/FoxL/tree/dev).
## How to use
Oh well, you just need to first download the interpreter of FoxL, which is the `FoxL.exe` you may find in the release section.  
After that, if you're on Windows, you're going use the command prompt like the following:  
```bat
<foxl_interpreter_path> <your_file>.foxl
```
And as if you're wondering, where's the other operating systems? Well, FoxL didn't support other operating system untill we drop it's first release.
## Introduce  
Here's a simple program written in FoxL to show you how it works:  
```foxl
write("Hello, world!");
```
Yeah, it's just that, you could figure the rest out yourself.  
## Syntax highlighting
Fortunately, there's a FoxL syntax highlighter available on the Visual Studio Code Extension Marketplace. You'll need it if you really want to code using FoxL
