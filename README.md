# FoxL
Sharp Fox's Programming Language Project.  
## Description  
This programming language (FoxL) was created, expect to be a high-level prgramming language that's ease to use for web-developer. Might release the next year.  
FoxL is for program developing, rather than web. But I hopes you'll find it suit yourself.
## How to use
Oh well, you just need to first download the interpreter of FoxL, which is the `FoxL.exe` you may find in the release section.  
After that, if you're on Windows, you're going use the command prompt like the following:  
```bat
<foxl_interpreter_path> <your_file>.foxl
```
And if you're wondering, where's the other operating system? Well, FoxL didn't support other operating system untill we drop it's first release.
